Unsupervised domain adaptation has been proposed recently to tackle the so-called domain shift between training data and test data with different distributions. However, most of them only focus on singletarget domain adaptation and cannot be applied to the scenario with multiple target domains. In this paper, we propose RVms, a novel unsupervised multi-target domain adaptation approach to segment retinal vessels (RVs) from multimodal and multicenter retinal images. RVms mainly consists of a style augmentation and transfer (SAT) module and a dual-teacher knowledge distillation (DTKD) module. SAT augments and clusters images into source-similar domains and source-dissimilar domains via BÂ´ezier and Fourier transformations. DTKD utilizes the augmented and transformed data to train two teachers, one for source-similar domains and the other for source-dissimilar domains. Afterwards, knowledge distillation is performed to iteratively distill different domain knowledge from teachers to a generic student. The local relative intensity transformation is employed to characterize RVs in a domain invariant manner and promote the generalizability of teachers and student models. Moreover, we construct a new multimodal and multicenter vascular segmentation dataset from existing publicly-available datasets, which can be used to benchmark various domain adaptation and domain generalization methods. Through extensive experiments, RVms is found to be very close to the target-trained Oracle in terms of segmenting the RVs, largely outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.
