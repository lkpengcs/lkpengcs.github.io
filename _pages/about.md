I received my B.Eng degree in computer science and engineering from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), where I conducted research under the guidance of Dr. [Xiaoying Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tQBqcr0AAAAJ).

My research focuses on medical image analysis, with a particular interest in foundational models, diffusion models, and multi-modal learning.

**I am actively seeking internships and collaboration opportunities!**
